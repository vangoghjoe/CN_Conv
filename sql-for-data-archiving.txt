how might the comparison work

CM
DBID
Type = TBA or NA
run - status = good or bad
overlap status =  good or bad

CM
DBID
Folder
Type = native or image
TBA = 0 or 1

foreach CM where type = TBA
    select * from Folder tba 
    join 
    Folder na
    on tba.folder = na.folder
    where tba.CM = $CM and tba.tba = 1
    and na.CM = $CM and na.tba = 0
    
For the list of folders, what do I need:
id
dbid
clientmatter
