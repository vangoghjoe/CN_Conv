goal:  
since the programs weren't writing status back to the DB, only way to know what failed and why is by culling through all the logs

what does client need:

list of errors for each db

for each row
    for each step: get-images get-natives
        need name of status file, name of status field
        if has error, 
            if not, set status ok 
        else
            write out the errors to a big file
                dcb | type | error message   (what if multiple lines?)
            set status to bad
        
    for each step:  add images, add natives
        if has error
            if not, nothing to do
        else
            write out the errors to a big file
                dcb | type | error message   (what if multiple lines?)
            
need to gather list of missing files
    can just cat them all together

1. total size of everything
    - get it by pulling nums into XLS and summing them
2. breakdown showing by DCB, showing sizes and num files
    have size of each thing (with errors), will need to combone them
    size of images and natives in the db
    size of db in that big file, as $db, $size, $numfiles
        the link between the file and the DB is the orig_dcb column
    easiest might be to recode the db pgm to use the DB.  Just take the logic and throw it a copy of run-check

client wants:
1. total size of everything
2. breakdown showing by DCB, showing sizes and num files
3. list of errors
4. list of files and dir's to copy 

other ideas:
check for other DCB's in same dir, may have to see if they are backups
