how else besides having a field in the DB can I know if something ran ok?

Can't really, just have to put it in there.

Can retroactively analyze the status files and fill in that info

Something listing 
pgm
status file name suffix
status field

so, is the biggest hangup adding all the fields to the CSV?  

Can put a list of fields in the lib and check the csv for them?  Sounds like overkill ...

then each script has to know what other status fields it depends on.
